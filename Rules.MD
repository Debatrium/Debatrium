## The Rules and Regulations
I know that you would not read a very long rules and regulations.<br>
So, here are all the rules:<br>
1.) No Hate<br>
2.) No Discrimination<br>
3.) Respect for everyone<br>
4.) No Illegal/Malicious content or topics<br>
5.) No Spam<br><br>
That's all, just 5. As we progress, I'll update the rules regularly.
